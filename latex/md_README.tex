The largest issue of the backend was dealing with the 16 bit-\/width as the file needed to be read in 8 bit chunks and then converted to 16 bit. This was a roadblock for a significant portion of the project as we could not work on any of the other file processing until we knew what format the data was going to be in a nd how we were going to interact with it.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Issues}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
No known missing functionality in the backend processors.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{U\+M\+L Diagram}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
