# Challenges
The largest issue of the backend was dealing with the 16 bit-width as the file needed to be read in 8 bit chunks and then converted to 16 bit. This was a roadblock for a significant portion of 
the project as we could not work on any of the other file processing until we knew what format the data was going to be in a nd how we were going to interact with it.

# Issues
No known missing functionality in the backend processors.
